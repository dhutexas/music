Musical Insights
-----------------------

Music is an everyday part of our lives and has never been more readily available. Streaming services offer up nearly anything we want and collect enormous quantities of data on the songs we listen to and how we listen to them. This repository is a collection of music data collected from various web sources (Billboard.com, Spotify, and Genius Lyrics) and various analyses conducted upon these data.
